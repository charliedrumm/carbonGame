## Overview

**Carbon Crusade** is an educational game developed in Java using JavaFX aimed at encouraging kids to understand the benefits of using public transport. Through gamification, players learn to balance time, carbon, and money budgets while collecting gems placed at random locations around the map.

The game ends when the player runs out of any one budget. Each time a player collects a gem, they are greeted with an educational popup that congratulates them and displays the best possible routes they could have taken.
